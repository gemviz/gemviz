Gemviz is a web-based tool for creating visualizations of genre ecology models. The visualizations are essentially non-directed graphs with annotations, so the tool may prove useful to anyone wanting to build a web-based graphing tool. The interface is in HTML+SVG, and scripted with the help of YUI.
