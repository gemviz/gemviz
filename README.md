Gemviz - the genre ecology model visualizer

https://github.com/gemviz/gemviz

Gemviz is a web-based tool for creating visualizations of genre ecology models. The visualizations are essentially non-directed graphs with annotations, so the tool may prove useful to anyone wanting to build a web-based graphing tool. The interface is in HTML+<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, and scripted with the help of <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/">YUI</a>.
